# sobekcm-plugin-sanborn-viewer

Special SobekCM plug-in adds a Sanborn-specific item viewer.  This item viewer uses existing GIF images and a HTML map file to display an index for the Sanborn map set.  This allows users to view the map from far above, and select a set rectangle to view that page more closely.

Once the plug-in is enabled, you will need to run the attach install script as well.

This was developed as a demonstration plug-in during the SobekCM Code Camp 2017 in Cape Canaveral, FL.
